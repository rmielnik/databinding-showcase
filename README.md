# Data binding showcase

                                                                                                                                                                                            This code demonstrates data binding in Android as well as a technique of managing async calls I presented during Toast meet up.

                                                                                                                                                                                            If you want to know more about Toast, please visit Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/toastwroclaw/?fref=nf
